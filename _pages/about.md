I am actively involved in a wide range of projects as part of my roles at the Machine Learning section and Data Science Lab of University of Copenhagen.

* COVID-19 Risk Modelling: 
	As part of a collaboration with the hospitals in Zealand region of Denmark, we are modelling COVID-19 risk from clinical and image data. I am contributing to the team focusing on using chest X-rays at admission to model risk of COVID-19.

* Uncertainty Quantification:
	
* Low Resource Machine Learning:
* Generative Modelling of nanoparticles:
* Locomotion analysis:
* Behavioural analysis of narwhals:
