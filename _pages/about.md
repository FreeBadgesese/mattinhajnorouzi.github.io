Bio 
======
Sneha Das is a tenure-track assistant professor with the section for Statistics and Data Analysis (STATS) at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (Compute), Technical University of Denmark (DTU). She works on multi-sensory data modelling with shared perspective from statistics, low-resource machine-learning and signal processing for applications in mental health and well-being. She is specifically interested in speech and multi-modal technology founded on equity and inclusiveness, whereby her current research focuses on technology for children and atypical populations.

Sneha received her PhD from Aalto University, Finland in 2021 within Speech and Language Technology, her MSc degree in Communication and Multimedia Engineering from Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany in 2016 and her Bachelor degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2013 (BMS Institute of Technology, India). Sneha was born in Kolkata, India.

Research Projects and Interests
======

Sneha Das is a tenure-track assistant professor with the section for Statistics and Data Analysis at the department for applied mathematics
and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). She works at the intersection of multi-sensory data modelling and statistics, with a special focus on speech technology for health and well-being. Broadly, her research interests span low resource and equitable machine-learning and signal processing methods. Prior to this, she was a
postdoctoral researcher for the WristAngel project, for the treatment and management of obsessive compulsive disorder for child and adolescent psychiatry. Through her past and current work, she is also working on equitable speech technologies for children under low-resource conditions. She received her PhD from Aalto University, Finland in 2021 within Speech and Language Technology and her dissertation was titled ‘Robust and Efficient Methods for Distributed Speech Processing- Perspectives on Coding,
Enhancement and Privacy’.  She received her masters degree from Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany in 2016.
