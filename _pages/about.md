Bio 
======

Raghavendra Selvan (Raghav) is currently a Postdoctoral researcher at the Machine Learning Section at the Department of Computer Science and the Data Science Lab of University of Copenhagen. He received his PhD in Medical Image Analysis from University of Copenhagen in 2018, his MSc degree in electrical engineering in 2015, from Chalmers University, Gothenburg, Sweden and his Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering degree from BMS Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India. Raghavendra Selvan was born in Bangalore, India.

His current research interests broadly include [Medical image analysis],[Graph-based learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08674), [Bayesian tracking theory](https://odr.chalmers.se/handle/20.500.12380/220888), Tensor networks, Approximate Bayesian inference and Deep generative modelling. 

Projects
======

I am actively involved in a wide range of projects as part of my roles at the Machine Learning section and Data Science Lab of University of Copenhagen. Brief descriptions of ongoing and completed projects are listed below.

Ongoing

* **COVID-19 Risk Modelling**: 
	As part of a collaboration with the hospitals in Zealand region of Denmark, we are modelling COVID-19 risk from clinical and image data. I am contributing to the team focusing on [using chest X-rays](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-01-01-Lung-Segmentation-from-Chest-X-rays-using-Variational-Data-Imputation) at admission to model risk of COVID-19.

* **Uncertainty Quantification**:
Medical image segmentation with meaningful uncertainty estimation can be more useful in clinical settings. With this in focus we proposed a [probabilistic segmentation model](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-01-01-Uncertainty-quantification-in-medical-image-segmentation-with-Normalizing-Flows) that uses normalizing flows to improve the diversity of segmented samples.

* Low Resource Machine Learning:
* Generative Modelling of nanoparticles:
* Locomotion analysis:
* Behavioural analysis of narwhals:
